⚠️ IMPORTANT: SET UP YOUR API KEY FIRST! ⚠️

Before running the app, you need to add your Gemini API key:

1. Open the file: .env.local

2. Replace this line:
   GEMINI_API_KEY=PLACEHOLDER_API_KEY

3. With your actual API key:
   GEMINI_API_KEY=AIza...your_actual_key_here

4. Get your API key from:
   https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey

5. Then run:
   npm run dev

6. Open your browser to:
   http://localhost:3000

That's it! The app should now work perfectly.
