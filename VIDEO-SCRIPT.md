## 🎯 Opening (0:00 - 0:20)
*[Show the login page]*

**"Hi! I'm excited to show you Student Mentor AI - an intelligent personal mentoring system built on Google Gemini 2.0 Flash for the Cloud Run Hackathon.**

**Unlike traditional learning platforms that only track grades, we've built a holistic ecosystem that monitors students' academics, mental health, physical wellness, and career aspirations - all while adapting to their age and maturity level."**

## 🔐 Authentication (0:20 - 0:35)
*[Click "Continue with Google" or sign in with email]*

**"Let me sign in. We have authentication to ensure student privacy and data security."**

*[If showing onboarding, briefly scroll through it; if already onboarded, skip to dashboard]*

**"For this demo, I've already completed the 6-step onboarding where students share their academic goals, interests, career aspirations, and any challenges they're facing."**

---

## 📊 Dashboard Overview (0:35 - 1:05)
*[Show the dashboard with analytics]*

**"Here's the student dashboard. Notice we're NOT displaying personal aspirations or sensitive data - that's intentional. We use it behind the scenes for AI personalization while keeping the dashboard focused on actionable metrics.**

**You can see:**
- **Mood trends** over time with pattern analysis
- **Study hours** tracking with visual progress bars
- **Homework completion rates**
- **Recent activity feed**
- **Active goals count** - which students can update anytime as their interests evolve"**

## 📚 Homework Management (1:05 - 1:30)
*[Click on "📚 Homework" in navigation]*

**"Let's check the homework section. Teachers assign tasks here, and students can:**
- **Filter** by status: All, Pending, or Completed
- **Sort** by due date or priority level
- **See overdue warnings** with countdown timers
- **Mark progress** as in-progress, completed, or submitted

*[Click on a homework item to show details]*

**Notice the priority levels - urgent, high, medium, low - and estimated time tracking. This helps students manage their workload effectively."**

---

## 📝 Tests & Exams (1:30 - 1:50)
*[Click on "📝 Tests" in navigation]*

**"The tests section shows all upcoming exams assigned by teachers.**

*[Show filtering options]*

**Students can filter by upcoming, today, or this week, and see:**
- **Test importance** - from quizzes to board exams
- **Syllabus coverage** and study materials
- **Preparation status tracking**
- **Personal notes** for each test

*[Click on a test to show details]*

**This helps students prepare systematically instead of cramming at the last minute."**

---

## 🤖 AI Mentor Chat (1:50 - 2:30)
*[Click on "🤖 AI Mentor" in navigation]*

**"Now for the core feature - our AI mentor powered by Gemini 2.0 Flash.**

*[Show existing conversation or type a message]*

**Let me ask something like: 'I'm feeling stressed about my upcoming math exam'**

*[Wait for AI response - should show streaming]*

**Watch how the AI responds with context awareness. It knows:**
- **My academic profile** and subjects
- **Recent mood patterns** from daily check-ins
- **My career goals** and learning style
- **Current challenges** I'm facing

*[Scroll to show conversation flow]*

**Most importantly - and this is the beta feature we're proud of - the AI detects when students are struggling. If I said something like 'I feel hopeless' or repeatedly mentioned academic difficulties, it would automatically trigger a teacher alert with AI-generated insights and intervention suggestions."**

---

## 👥 Peer Chat (2:30 - 2:45)
*[Click on "👥 Peers" in navigation]*

**"Students can also chat with classmates and teachers directly.**

*[Show contact list]*

## 🎯 Goals Management (2:45 - 3:05)
*[Click on profile icon → "🎯 Edit Goals"]*

**"Here's something unique - dynamic goals management.**

*[Show the goals editor modal with tabs]*

**Students can update:**
- **Current focus areas**
- **Short-term goals** (3-6 months)
- **Long-term aspirations** (1+ years)
- **Career interests** and hobbies

**Why? Because a 14-year-old who wants to be a doctor might discover a passion for engineering. Our system adapts with them instead of locking them into outdated aspirations."**

*[Click through tabs to show different sections]*

---

## ✅ Daily Check-In (3:05 - 3:25)
*[Click "Check In" button if available, or show check-in modal]*

**"The daily check-in is how we gather holistic data.**

*[Show the 4-step process]*

**Students track:**
1. **Mood and mental state** with stress and energy levels
2. **Academic activities** - subjects studied, homework completion
3. **Physical and social activities**
4. **Daily achievements**

**This builds a comprehensive profile that helps the AI detect patterns and provide better support."**

*[Click "📄 Report" button]*

**"Teachers and parents can generate comprehensive reports showing:**

*[Scroll through report sections]*

- **Academic performance analysis**
- **Mental health and well-being trends**
- **Physical activity tracking**

## 🚀 Closing & Vision (3:40 - 4:00)
*[Return to dashboard or show GitHub page]*

**"This is our MVP built in just 10 days, but the vision is much bigger.**

- **Multiple AI agents** working together - academic, career, wellness, and social agents
- **Desktop and mobile apps** for seamless access
- **Gamification** with achievements, streaks, and rewards to replace social media addiction
- **Smart notifications** for tasks, deadlines, and messages
- **Practical learning paths** that adapt whether you're a topper or struggling

**We've proven the concept works. With support from the community, educational institutions, and Google Cloud, we can scale this to help millions of students worldwide.**
